DualPDF
=======
This is a small demo project that uses the whole iOS device screen to display two PDF file side by side at the same time. The two files could be the same one or different ones. Usually one big disadvantage of eLearning with PDF on iPad or iPhone is you can't do referencing by turning the book (PDF) back and forth in two fixed points. With DualPDF, for example, you could check the problem on page 10 and looking for example answer on page 110 at the same time. By doing so, your thoughts won't be interrupted easily by turning pages.
